# .uplift.yaml
# Example of bumping a package.json file

# Use annotated tags instead of lightweight tags when tagging a new
# semantic version. An annotated tag is treated like a regular commit
# by git and contains both author details and a commit message. Uplift
# will either use its defaults or the custom commit details provided
# when generated the annotated tag.
#
# Defaults to false
annotatedTags: true

# Customise the creation of the Changelog
changelog:
  # Change the sort order of the commits within each changelog entry.
  # Supported values are asc or desc (case is ignored)
  #
  # Defaults to desc (descending order) to mirror the default behaviour
  # of "git log"
  sort: asc

  # A list of commits to exclude during the creation of a changelog.
  # Provide a list of regular expressions for matching commits that
  # are to be excluded. Auto-generated commits from Uplift
  # (with the prefix ci(uplift)) will always be excluded
  #
  # Defaults to an empty list. All commits are included
  exclude:
    - ^docs
    - ^ci

  # A list of commits to cherry-pick and include during the creation
  # of a changelog. Provide a list of regular expressions for matching
  # commits that are to be included
  #include:
  #- '^.*\(scope\)'

  # Include multiline commit messages within the changelog. Disables
  # default behaviour of truncating a commit message to its first line
  #multiline: true

# Changes the default commit message used by Uplift when committing
# any staged changes.
#
# Default commit message is: ci(uplift): uplifted for version v0.1.0
#commitMessage: "ci(release): release commit"
